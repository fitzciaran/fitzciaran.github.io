put in a click to start first menu real info screen

pilot select should be one image and click through options
should be able to select color and....other stuff?
powerups shouldn't spawn too close to ships (not super important for now)
create a lot of enums instead of random string passing around
start building test suite for this project
shooting stars effect
gravity black hole - reappear warp
powerups and black holes disappear after time, blinking out at the end.
moving power powerUps
different size different score powerUps
lobby selection
1 player mode?
select ship - different stats - different... special?
    specials... invicible, knock away in radius,mines?
enter name
lobby
ai ships
starting menu
starting lore screens (mk1 style)
different craft/ pilots
char select effects/ design
pilot select

music
sound effects
review acceleration
need some forground objects to get sense of speed
reset camera on new game (check how it's done the first time)
simple lobby system could just be selecting from a list of lobbies and that sets which array of id's you use - from there it works the same p2p as now

When a ship collides with one of these the ship should get slightly bigger. 
We'll need to keep track of all ships size
When ships collide with each other the biggest should "win" and the smaller should be removed from the game for 3 seconds before respawning at a random location 
or the front of the ship stabs?
show the game at all times with name entry and ship selection together
kill bonus 
some kind of win condition?
keep camera more centered need to keep visability
shrinking level - could be all around or could be left to right to require progress

some kind of share option - a la wordle 

enemies - lose point if touched
different types ^
PvE?
general racing 
    like this - power up could be speed boost, or have separate boosts and power ups are mk style
    drafting mechanic?
    "jumps?"
    lap records
    daily/all time leaderboards
procedural level generation?

basic carfootball style game?

some kind of starting state whether for ^ or other

new challenger approaches when connect to someone
some kind of run game with the mouse / ship mechanic/physics we have
sumo mechanic
how to p2p with run style game
maybe colliding just kills both players?
maybe other things to avoid too - like not "fake players" but general enviroment obstacle

secret button to become master or to give up master status for testing - might be unneccesary
might have to do a proper server for master game state - daily leaderboards
on screen arrow to direct to offscreen oppoents
update UI of drawn oppoents name on craft in the world
color select on craft select
table of current leaders
make ships bigger
maybe always provide thrust at low level - with limited click boost - need rechargable boost meter. - lean into these for char differences

share connection list so everyone matches - master only shares list of connected id's - if master shares an id not in list add it, if master is missing one maybe need a push to master.
issue when master disconnects.. or not quite disconnects but stops being active, maybe some kind of timer and if no message disconnect... might need to send a message to others to disconnect from it too...?
or at least check connections/otherPlayers list for one's that should be removed (how to check "inactive" - could maintain a "ticks since last message" variable or maybe better to timestamp the last update sent)

deal with null id (peers not working) better, probably make master, maybe more.
a new challenger approaches  screen when someone joins?
getting pulled in the direction of a few different types of games currently ... thats fine for now tho
rollback prediction for other players? or even for ai that master is processing?

camera follow host before the game starts? - try out following the bots see how it is.

move player processing logic into the player object so can use for bots.
maybe move player inputs into player logic for same reason

bots can appear jittery on non-master peers

need to introduce the idea of ongoing game so lose state for one is only local for them
maybe you lose health as time goes by and you have to keep up with picking up power ups to restore?
neaten current scores text - maybe put in a box too? 
some visual effect when ships hit
draw shadows
leader mark drawn - bonus for killing
way to attack without getting hurt - maybe speed/angle - maybe states - pacman style? mario star style?
     - maybe when collected a few normal power ups? maybe they fill a guage which drains slowly which thrusting
    - this would become the way mainly score
make ships much bigger
Compete for large moving powerups, possibly in addition to the star mario/pac man state
maybe also moving large obstacles (non-lethal?) pushing? and lethal.
level ups? more gauges?
worldDimensions maybe don't let Player know about this an have to always pass in a parameter to methods?
camera shake
bots should "attack" when have star only ?
bots should "run" when don't? - or go for powerups?
faster when star??
gauge to show invicibletime? or use audio? - stop flashing slightly before? - for local player only?
display combo multiplier in ui (when above 1)?
spawn protection?
something to make text more visible in general
update "powerups" verbage to "score" throughout
update follow code to take into acount velocity of ship following. - maybe consider how far away to determine how far ahead to look
include kills tracking in leaderboard/score report?
notion of lives 3,2,1 GO if hit and have lives left - animation showing life icon being removed.
keep track of killed by and show on screen
keep track of historical kills? - revenge kill bonus/acknowledgement? 
- unique messaging if killed by multiple times? rival?

background on name entry like on the leaderboards/lore
refactor box drawing?
check this probably doesn't work but have put something in: timer for how long since heard from master... kick master from connections and otherplayers if 
issue with non-master peer sometimes powerups/enemies get restored (presumably by the master) as soon as we hits them, resulting in multiple hits/collection/kills
wait to see if will connect to a master before creating bots/powerups ourselves. - hopefully before playing ourselves... maybe hold off on showing game??
consider better options for right click.
isMastervariable outside of player object?
another, closer, "inRangeticks variable for botstate?
