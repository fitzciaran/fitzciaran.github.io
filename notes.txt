min speed should be further away
powerups should not generate near the edge,
powerups should be rendered a little larger on the minimap

I want the ships to check for collision with the powerup and if they collide with it the power up should disappear and a property on the ship be incremented. THe powerup should be removed. This info should be sent to the other connected peers

When a ship collides with one of these the ship should get slightly bigger. 
We'll need to keep track of all ships size
When ships collide with each other the biggest should "win" and the smaller should be removed from the game for 3 seconds before respawning at a random location
