put in a click to start first menu real info screen

pilot select should be one image and click through options
should be able to select color and....other stuff?
powerups shouldn't spawn too close to ships (not super important for now)
create a lot of enums instead of random string passing around
start building test suite for this project
shooting stars effect
gravity black hole - reappear warp
powerups and black holes disappear after time, blinking out at the end.
moving power powerUps
different size different score powerUps
lobby selection
1 player mode?
select ship - different stats - different... special?
    specials... invicible, knock away in radius,mines?
enter name
lobby
ai ships
starting menu
starting lore screens (mk1 style)
different craft/ pilots
char select effects/ design
pilot select

music
sound effects
review acceleration
need some forground objects to get sense of speed
reset camera on new game (check how it's done the first time)
simple lobby system could just be selecting from a list of lobbies and that sets which array of id's you use - from there it works the same p2p as now

When a ship collides with one of these the ship should get slightly bigger. 
We'll need to keep track of all ships size
When ships collide with each other the biggest should "win" and the smaller should be removed from the game for 3 seconds before respawning at a random location 
or the front of the ship stabs?
show the game at all times with name entry and ship selection together
kill bonus 
some kind of win condition?
keep camera more centered need to keep visability
shrinking level - could be all around or could be left to right to require progress

some kind of share option - a la wordle 

enemies - lose point if touched
different types ^
PvE?
general racing 
    like this - power up could be speed boost, or have separate boosts and power ups are mk style
    drafting mechanic?
    "jumps?"
    lap records
    daily/all time leaderboards
procedural level generation?

basic carfootball style game?

some kind of starting state whether for ^ or other

new challenger approaches when connect to someone
some kind of run game with the mouse / ship mechanic/physics we have
sumo mechanic
how to p2p with run style game
maybe colliding just kills both players?
maybe other things to avoid too - like not "fake players" but general enviroment obstacle

secret button to become master or to give up master status for testing - might be unneccesary
might have to do a proper server for master game state - daily leaderboards
on screen arrow to direct to offscreen oppoents
draw oppoents name on craft in the world
color select on craft select
table of current leaders
make ships bigger
maybe always provide thrust at low level - with limited click boost - need rechargable boost meter. - lean into these for char differences

share connection list so everyone matches - master only shares list of connected id's - if master shares an id not in list add it, if master is missing one maybe need a push to master.
issue when master disconnects.. or not quite disconnects but stops being active, maybe some kind of timer and if no message disconnect... might need to send a message to others to disconnect from it too...?
or at least check connections/otherPlayers list for one's that should be removed (how to check "inactive" - could maintain a "ticks since last message" variable)

deal with null id (peers not working) better, probably make master, maybe more.
a new challenge screen when someone joins?
getting pulled in the direction of a few different types of games currently ... thats fine for now tho
rollback prediction for other players? or even for ai that master is processing?

camera follow host before the game starts?
move player processing logic into the player object so can use for bots.
maybe move player inputs into player logic for same reason
