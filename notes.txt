put in a click to start first menu real info screen
finish refactoring game state handler adding / removing for inputHandlers
looking cursor/text / canvas? position after first game - look at enteryou name text movement too
reset state variables (find out which) after first loop 
pilot select state is broken no lore or Highlight
powerups shouldn't spawn too close to ships (not super important for now)
create a lot of enums instead of random string passing around
start building test suite for this project
shooting stars effect
gravity black hole - reappear warp
powerups and black holes disappear after time, blinking out at the end.
moving power powerUps
different size different score powerUps
lobby selection
1 player mode?
select ship - different stats
enter name
lobby
ai ships
starting menu
starting lore screens (mk1 style)
different craft/ pilots
char select effects/ design
pilot select
make connection more robust
make powerup sharing more robust
music
sound effects
review acceleration
need some forground objects to get sense of speed
reset camera on new game (check how it's done the first time)
simple lobby system could just be selecting from a list of lobbies and that sets which array of id's you use - from there it works the same p2p as now

When a ship collides with one of these the ship should get slightly bigger. 
We'll need to keep track of all ships size
When ships collide with each other the biggest should "win" and the smaller should be removed from the game for 3 seconds before respawning at a random location 
or the front of the ship stabs?
show the game at all times with name entry and ship selection together
kill bonus 
some kind of win conidtion
keep camera more centered need to keep visability
shrinking level - could be all around or could be left to right to require progress

some kind of share option - a la wordle 
instead of p2p maybe make one player the host, first check for existing hosts if not become host and listen... kinda the same but one player gets the host role and controls state
    this is master peer lets try this
    todo continue work on this.
might have to do a proper server for master game state
on screen arrow to direct to offscreen oppoents
draw oppoents name on craft in the world
color select on craft select
